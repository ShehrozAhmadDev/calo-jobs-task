# Job Management System

## Project Summary

### Overview

This project implements a job management system with a backend built on **Node.js (Express with TypeScript)** and a frontend using **Next.js**. The system fetches random Unsplash food images with job execution times ranging from 5 seconds to 5 minutes.

### Key Features

1. **Asynchronous Job Processing**:
   Jobs are processed on the backend using **Worker Threads**, which allow concurrent processing without overloading the event loop. This ensures the backend remains responsive, even under heavy job loads.

2. **Real-Time Updates with SSE**:
   The server uses **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** to notify the client in real-time when a job is resolved. This eliminates the need for polling and enhances user experience by providing immediate updates.

3. **Efficient Concurrency**:
   Worker Threads enable the server to handle multiple jobs concurrently. Each job fetches a random Unsplash image and saves the result, ensuring scalability and smooth performance.

4. **Client-Side Functionality**:

   - Users can view the status of jobs or their results if resolved.
   - New jobs can be created directly through the UI.
   - Results are displayed automatically upon job completion via SSE.
     The client interface is built with **Next.js**, styled using **Tailwind CSS**, and features components from **shadcn** for a modern, responsive design.

5. **Data Persistence**:
   Job results are stored in a file-based system, ensuring that data remains available for retrieval even after server restarts.

## Installation Guide

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the respective directories and install dependencies.

   **For the Client**:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

   > **Note**: If this doesnâ€™t work or you face dependency issues, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

   **For the Server**:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Client**:
   Navigate to the `client` folder and start the development server.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Start the Server**:
   Navigate to the `server` folder and start the server.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Environment Configuration**:
   The `.env` file is already included in the project for both client and server; no additional setup is required.
